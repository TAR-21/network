# 2025 Enterprise Report on Red Hat OpenShift Network Observability: A Strategic Analysis of Visualization and Security Solutions

## Chapter 1: Executive Summary

### 1.1. The Need for Visibility

Red Hat OpenShift has established itself as the industry-standard platform for deploying and managing containerized applications. However, its dynamic and abstracted network environment presents new challenges that traditional monitoring tools cannot address. The lifecycle of containers is short, IP addresses are constantly changing, and communication between services (East-West traffic) occurs within an encrypted overlay network that transcends physical network boundaries. In this "black box" environment, ensuring advanced network observability (visibility) is not merely an operational requirement but a strategic imperative that underpins security, compliance, performance, and business continuity. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of solutions for visualizing networks in conjunction with OpenShift, offering strategic guidance for technology leaders to make informed decisions.

### 1.2. Solution Landscape Overview

Solutions for achieving network visibility in OpenShift can be broadly categorized into four architectural approaches. First are solutions that leverage eBPF, an innovative Linux kernel technology, to achieve detailed visibility from L3 to L7 with low overhead. Second is the service mesh, which places a sidecar proxy in each application to provide application-level traffic control, security, and visibility. Third are CNI (Container Network Interface) integrated solutions, such as Cisco ACI, which extend existing data center network fabrics into the OpenShift cluster, integrating physical, virtual, and container environments into a single management plane. Fourth are infrastructure-centric solutions that collect telemetry via host agents or orchestrator APIs for analysis and visualization on an external platform. Each of these approaches has different trade-offs, and the optimal choice depends on an organization's requirements and maturity.

### 1.3. Key Findings and Strategic Recommendations

The key conclusions drawn from the analysis in this report are as follows:

1.  **Shift to eBPF:** The industry is clearly shifting towards eBPF-based approaches that avoid the overhead of sidecar proxies and collect data more efficiently at the kernel level. This enables advanced visibility and security with minimal performance impact.
2.  **Convergence towards CNAPP:** Traditionally separate domains such as network visibility, security policy enforcement, vulnerability management, and compliance monitoring are increasingly converging into a single Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP).
3.  **Optimal Solution Depends on Persona:** The concept of a "single pane of glass" means different things to different personas (network operators, platform engineers, security personnel, etc.). The optimal solution must be evaluated from an organizational perspective on how it can provide the visibility and control required by each team.

Based on these findings, the following strategic recommendations are presented. First, it is essential to clearly define the primary use case for solution selection, such as security enhancement, developer self-service, or integration with existing infrastructure. Second, the choice of CNI fundamentally determines the cluster's network capabilities and visualization strategy, so it must be carefully considered during the initial design phase. Finally, while the native monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana) is powerful, maximizing its potential requires advanced expertise, so the possibility of reducing TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) through the adoption of commercial solutions should also be included in the evaluation.

## Chapter 2: OpenShift Network Fabric: Architecture and Abstraction

To evaluate OpenShift network visualization solutions, it is first essential to understand its underlying network architecture. OpenShift employs a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) approach that abstracts the physical infrastructure, which is the source of both its flexibility and its visibility challenges.

### 2.1. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Core

OpenShift's network is not dependent on physical routers or firewalls but instead builds a virtual network layer defined by software. This SDN approach allows for unified management of Pod-to-Pod communication across the cluster, enabling developers to focus on application development without being concerned with the complexities of network configuration. The CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin is what makes this virtual network possible, and OpenShift has primarily offered two native CNIs.

  * **OpenShift SDN:** The native CNI provided since early versions, based on Open vSwitch (OVS). This plugin offers three modes depending on operational requirements.

      * `ovs-subnet`: The simplest mode, providing a flat network where all Pods can communicate with each other.
      * `ovs-multitenant`: Provides network isolation at the project level (equivalent to Kubernetes Namespaces). Each project is assigned a unique Virtual Network ID (VNID), and communication between Pods in different projects is blocked by default.
      * `ovs-networkpolicy`: A mode that allows for more detailed traffic control using Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` resources. This enables the definition of flexible isolation policies at the Pod level.

  * **OVN-Kubernetes:** The default, more modern, and feature-rich CNI since OpenShift 4. Based on Open Virtual Network (OVN), it is designed to overcome the performance and scalability challenges of the traditional OpenShift SDN. OVN-Kubernetes supports more advanced network features (e.g., IPv6 dual-stack, ECMP) and is the current mainstream for OpenShift networking.

This abstraction by SDN is the source of OpenShift's portability and powerful functionality, but it also creates a significant barrier for traditional network monitoring methods. Tools like port mirroring on physical network switches or NetFlow cannot see the contents of East-West traffic encapsulated by protocols like VXLAN between nodes. In other words, the convenience brought to developers and platform operators creates a serious lack of visibility (a blind spot) for network security and operations teams. To solve this problem, a new generation of container-aware visualization solutions is essential.

### 2.2. Key Network Components and Traffic Flow

Communication within an OpenShift cluster is established through the coordination of the following key components.

  * **Pods:** The smallest deployable unit in OpenShift, containing one or more containers. Each Pod is assigned a unique IP address from the Pod network's CIDR range. Communication between Pods on the same node occurs directly through the OVS bridge (`br0`) within the node. Communication between Pods on different nodes is encapsulated by an overlay protocol like VXLAN, passes through the physical network to the destination node, where it is decapsulated and forwarded to the target Pod.
  * **Services:** Since Pods are dynamically created and deleted, their IP addresses are not persistent. A Service provides a single, stable access point (a virtual IP called ClusterIP) for a group of Pods with a specific label. This allows other application components to access the service via a consistent endpoint, regardless of Pod scaling or restarts. Services also play a role in load balancing traffic to Pods.
  * **Routes & Ingress:** Mechanisms for routing traffic from outside the cluster (North-South traffic) to Services inside the cluster. A Route is an OpenShift-specific resource that provides a simple way to map a hostname to a Service. Ingress is a standard Kubernetes feature that allows for the definition of more complex routing rules. These resources are processed by an Ingress Controller, which forwards external requests to the appropriate Service.

### 2.3. Visibility Gaps in the Native Environment

While OpenShift provides a robust network fabric, its standard features alone make it difficult to gain deep insight into the "nature" of the traffic flowing within that fabric. Default tools can tell you which Pods are communicating, but not what the content of that communication is (e.g., a specific API call) or whether that communication is legitimate.

The choice of CNI plugin is of most strategic importance in filling this visibility gap. The CNI is not just a network wiring layer, but a foundational data collection and policy enforcement point in an advanced network visibility strategy. Third-party CNIs like Cilium or the Cisco ACI CNI replace the default CNI, gaining privileged control over all packets entering and exiting a Pod. This strategic positioning allows them to collect telemetry and apply policies much more efficiently and powerfully than monitoring the network from the outside. Therefore, an organization's observability strategy must be thoroughly considered during the initial cluster design phase, as changing the CNI of a running production cluster is a very difficult task.

## Chapter 3: Modern Observability Challenges: Why Container Networks are a Black Box

The visibility gaps identified in Chapter 2 are further exacerbated by the unique nature of containerized environments. This chapter delves into the specific security and operational challenges that drive the need for specialized solutions.

### 3.1. Ephemeral and Dynamic Environments

The lifecycle of containers is very short, ranging from seconds to days, and they scale dynamically (increase/decrease) according to demand. Traditional monitoring tools, which assume static IP addresses, do not function effectively in such environments where IP addresses are constantly reused. A specific IP address might be assigned to a web server at one moment and a database the next, causing IP-based logs and metrics to lose context and making troubleshooting significantly more difficult.

Furthermore, large-scale container environments generate a vast amount of data, increasing the risk of "alert fatigue". With thousands of containers each emitting metrics and logs, a monitoring solution must not only collect data but also feature intelligent alerting and customizable dashboards to filter out noise and highlight truly important insights.

### 3.2. The Unmonitored East-West Corridor and Lateral Movement

One of the biggest security risks in container networks is insufficiently monitored East-West traffic (internal communication between containers). The default settings in Kubernetes and OpenShift create a flat network inside the cluster, where, in principle, any Pod can attempt to communicate with any other Pod.

This situation is an attractive target for attackers. If an attacker succeeds in compromising a single, relatively less-defended container (e.g., a public-facing web frontend), they can use that container as a foothold to reconnoiter the internal network of the cluster and launch attacks laterally against high-value targets like databases. This type of attack completely bypasses traditional perimeter firewalls, making it very difficult to detect. To mitigate this risk, micro-segmentation (an approach that strictly limits communication on a Pod or service basis) is essential, and its implementation presupposes complete visibility of East-West traffic.

### 3.3. Blind Spots in the Software Supply Chain

Network security is closely related to the identity and integrity of the workload. A single container image may contain hundreds of open-source components and libraries, each with the risk of containing vulnerabilities. Even if a Pod exhibiting suspicious behavior on the network can be identified, if it is not known what software that Pod is composed of, identifying and remediating the root cause is difficult.

This is where the SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) becomes important. An SBOM provides an inventory of all components that make up a container image (libraries, dependencies, version information, etc.) and is a fundamental tool for ensuring transparency in the software supply chain. A network visualization solution can provide deeper insights by correlating behavior on the network ("what it is doing") with workload composition information obtained from an SBOM ("who is running it").

### 3.4. The Need for Contextualized Visibility

The central challenge in modern observability is not a lack of data, but a lack of context. Raw network flow information, such as "IP address A communicated with IP address B," is almost meaningless on its own. An effective visualization solution must enrich this flow information by adding Kubernetes/OpenShift metadata to provide context. For example, it must be able to provide information at the level of "Pod `frontend-xyz` in the `prod-web` namespace sent an HTTP POST request to Service `billing-api` in the `prod-backend` namespace".

Only with this contextualized information can operators quickly identify abnormal communication patterns, security personnel define meaningful policies, and developers accurately understand application dependencies. In a microservices architecture, the concept of a network perimeter has effectively disappeared, and security can no longer be based on "location," such as IP addresses or network segments, but must be based on the verifiable identity of the workload itself ("who"). This paradigm shift forms the basis of the zero-trust model, which explicitly verifies all communication. And the first step to achieving this zero-trust is to accurately grasp "who is communicating with whom, and how"—that is, to ensure comprehensive visibility. Before an effective micro-segmentation policy can be implemented, all current communication paths must first be mapped in detail and accurately.

## Chapter 4: Architectural Approaches to Network Visualization

Solutions for achieving network visibility in OpenShift each have different architectures, features, and trade-offs. This chapter analyzes the main approaches in detail, clarifying how each solution provides visibility and what challenges it solves.

### 4.1. CNI-Integrated and eBPF-Powered Visualization

This approach integrates visualization and security functions directly into the CNI plugin, the foundation of the network, and has gained significant attention, especially with the advent of eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology.

#### Introduction to eBPF

eBPF is an innovative technology that allows sandboxed programs to be run dynamically within the Linux kernel without changing the kernel's source code or adding kernel modules. By attaching eBPF programs to hook points such as network I/O or application sockets, it is possible to process packets directly in kernel space and implement networking, observability, and security logic. This allows for detailed monitoring and control of system behavior at near-native performance, without application changes or the intervention of a sidecar proxy.

#### Detailed Analysis: Cilium and Hubble

  * **Architecture:** Cilium is a high-performance CNI plugin that fully utilizes eBPF. It replaces OpenShift's default CNI and handles all networking, observability, and security in the eBPF data plane. Hubble is an observability platform built on top of Cilium, consisting of a server running on each node, a Hubble Relay that aggregates flow data for the entire cluster, and a UI and CLI. It is certified for the Red Hat OpenShift Platform and can be deployed via an Operator.

  * **Visualization:** The Hubble UI automatically discovers service dependencies within the cluster from L3/L4 to L7 levels and visualizes them as a dynamic service map. On this map, you can check metrics such as traffic flow between services, request rates, latency, and HTTP status codes in real time. Furthermore, by selecting a specific flow, it is possible to drill down and investigate detailed information such as source/destination Pod names, IP addresses, ports, applied network policies, and the verdict (allow/deny) of communication by the policy.

  * **L7 Visibility without Sidecars:** Cilium's most significant feature is its ability to achieve L7 protocol visibility without a sidecar proxy. This is achieved by attaching eBPF programs to `socket`-level system calls or kernel tracepoints. The eBPF programs directly parse the payload of TCP packets in kernel space to extract application-layer information such as HTTP request methods (GET, POST, etc.) and paths (`/api/v1/users`, etc.), gRPC services/methods, and DNS queries. This approach has the significant advantage of greatly reducing resource consumption and latency compared to a service mesh that injects a sidecar into each Pod. Below is an example of a `CiliumNetworkPolicy` that restricts HTTP requests.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
    kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: "public-api-only"
    spec:
      endpointSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: service
      ingress:
      - fromEndpoints:
        - matchLabels:
            env: prod
        toPorts:
        - ports:
          - port: "80"
            protocol: TCP
          rules:
            http:
            - method: "GET"
              path: "/public"
    ```

#### Detailed Analysis: Cisco ACI CNI Plugin

  * **Architecture:** This solution directly extends the mainstream data center network fabric, Cisco ACI (Application Centric Infrastructure), into the OpenShift cluster. When the ACI CNI plugin is installed, OpenShift Pods and Services are recognized as native endpoints of the ACI fabric and are managed centrally through ACI's controller, the APIC (Application Policy Infrastructure Controller).

  * **Visualization:** The network operations team can fully visualize the connectivity status and health of OpenShift workloads (projects, deployments, Pods, etc.) alongside traditional virtual machines and bare-metal servers through the familiar APIC GUI. This makes it possible to grasp the entire data center network, from the physical network to the container network, from a single management screen.

  * **Key Benefits:** Integration with ACI eliminates the need for an Egress Router, which can be a bottleneck in default OpenShift implementations, achieving high-bandwidth, low-latency communication from Pods to the outside. It also enables load balancing utilizing the ACI fabric's hardware and the application of unified micro-segmentation policies across container and non-container environments using ACI's fundamental concepts of EPGs (End-Point Groups) and contracts.

### 4.2. The Service Mesh Paradigm

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for ensuring the reliability, security, and visibility of service-to-service communication without changing the application code.

#### Introduction to Service Mesh

In this approach, a lightweight network proxy (usually Envoy), called a "sidecar," is placed next to the application container, transparently intercepting all network traffic in and out of the application. This allows for the centralized provision of advanced traffic management (A/B testing, canary releases), service-to-service authentication (mTLS), and detailed telemetry collection, separate from the application.

#### Detailed Analysis: OpenShift Service Mesh (Istio) and Kiali

  * **Architecture:** Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh is a productized version of the open-source Istio. The architecture consists of a control plane (Istiod) that handles the configuration and management of the entire mesh, and a data plane (Envoy sidecar proxies injected into each Pod) that actually processes the traffic. Installation is done via an OpenShift Operator, simplifying lifecycle management.

  * **Visualization with Kiali:** Kiali is the official visualization and management console for Istio. The Kiali dashboard provides a rich set of features for intuitively understanding the state of the service mesh.

      * **Topology:** It discovers service-to-service communication in real time and dynamically draws it as a service graph. This allows you to see at a glance which services depend on which other services.
      * **Health and Metrics:** It displays the health of each service and workload with color coding and presents graphs of the "golden signals" of monitoring, such as latency, traffic volume, error rate, and saturation.
      * **Distributed Tracing:** It integrates with Jaeger to visualize the overall flow (trace) of a single request as it traverses multiple microservices. This makes it easier to identify performance bottlenecks and the root causes of errors.
      * **Configuration and Validation:** It provides a YAML editor for viewing and editing Istio configuration resources like `VirtualService` and `DestinationRule`, and automatically detects and warns about configuration errors or deviations from best practices.

#### Future Outlook: Istio Ambient Mesh

The traditional sidecar model, in exchange for its functionality, has been challenged by increased resource consumption (CPU, memory) for each Pod and operational complexity such as sidecar injection and upgrades. To address this challenge, Istio has introduced a new sidecar-less architecture called "Ambient Mesh." Ambient Mesh separates functionality into two layers. L4 security (mTLS) and telemetry are handled by a component called `ztunnel`, with only one placed on each node, and a `waypoint proxy` is optionally deployed only for services that require advanced L7 traffic management. This approach is expected to significantly reduce resource overhead and simplify the introduction and operation of a service mesh.

### 4.3. Infrastructure-Centric and API-Driven Solutions

This approach does not depend on a specific CNI but focuses on collecting information from agents installed on the host or from the orchestrator's API and analyzing and visualizing it on an external platform.

#### Detailed Analysis: Cisco Secure Workload (formerly Tetration)

  * **Architecture:** Cisco Secure Workload is a platform for protecting workloads across heterogeneous environments, from on-premises to multi-cloud. Data collection is performed by software agents installed on the workloads (VMs, bare metal, container hosts) and telemetry from network hardware. In an OpenShift environment, it integrates with the cluster's API server to ingest metadata such as Pod and Service labels and annotations in real time.

  * **Visualization and Policy Generation:** The core feature of Secure Workload is its ability to analyze the collected flow information and metadata using machine learning and behavioral analysis algorithms to automatically generate an Application Dependency Map (ADM). The ADM visualizes in detail which application components are communicating on which ports/protocols. This map serves as a baseline for achieving a zero-trust model and can automatically generate micro-segmentation policies that only allow observed communication.

#### Detailed Analysis: Arista CloudVision and Container Tracer

  * **Architecture:** Arista CloudVision is a platform for managing, automating, and collecting telemetry for the entire network composed of Arista switches. Its `Container Tracer` feature is specialized for integrating with container orchestrators like Kubernetes and OpenShift. `Container Tracer` learns container placement information (which container is running on which node) and identity via the orchestrator's API. It then correlates this information with network telemetry streamed in real time from Arista switches.

  * **Visualization:** This integration allows network operators to accurately track which switch and which port a specific container is physically connected to. This simplifies troubleshooting for containerized workloads and bridges the gap between the virtual container world and the physical network infrastructure world.

### 4.4. Ingress and Edge-Centric Visualization

This approach focuses primarily on the visualization and control of North-South traffic that crosses the boundary (edge) with the outside, rather than the East-West traffic inside the cluster.

#### Detailed Analysis: F5 BIG-IP and Container Ingress Services (CIS)

  * **Architecture:** F5's CIS is a controller that runs within the OpenShift cluster. CIS monitors the Kubernetes API and, upon detecting the creation or modification of `Ingress`, `Route`, or F5's own custom resources (CRDs), it automatically updates the configuration of the F5 BIG-IP appliance located outside the cluster.

  * **Visualization:** While control is managed from the OpenShift side, visualization is achieved by leveraging the rich telemetry features of BIG-IP. BIG-IP generates detailed L4 to L7 statistical information (throughput, latency, HTTP response codes, security events, etc.) for all the traffic it processes. By exporting this data stream to an external analysis platform like Splunk or the ELK Stack, it is possible to gain deep insights into the performance, usage, and security threats of North-South traffic.

Comparing these architectures, a clear technical conflict exists between the eBPF approach (Cilium) and the service mesh sidecar approach (Istio). This is a central architectural debate in cloud-native networking. Service meshes offer a rich set of advanced L7 traffic management features (traffic shifting, retries, etc.), but at the cost of resource overhead and operational complexity for each Pod. On the other hand, eBPF solutions offer superior performance and low overhead by operating in the kernel, achieving L3-L7 visibility and security without modifying the Pod. The development of the sidecar-less Ambient Mesh by Istio is a direct response to the challenges posed by eBPF and can be seen as an attempt to find a middle ground. For architects, this represents a significant trade-off: choose a mature and feature-rich but potentially heavy service mesh, or a high-performance and efficient but possibly less mature in L7 features eBPF solution. This choice largely depends on whether the primary requirement is advanced application traffic management or a high-performance security and observability foundation.

Furthermore, while solutions like Cisco ACI and Arista CloudVision claim a "single pane of glass," it is necessary to critically evaluate from whose perspective that unified view is. ACI provides a unified view for the network operations team, but it is rare for developers or SREs working within OpenShift to log into APIC. For them, the "single pane of glass" is the OpenShift console, Kiali, or Grafana. The most effective solutions are those with integration capabilities that provide data to the tools preferred by each persona, not those that force a single tool on everyone.

## Chapter 5: Leveraging Native and Open Source Ecosystems

Before introducing a commercial solution, it is important to understand the capabilities of the monitoring tools included by default in OpenShift or available as open source to establish a baseline and evaluate the return on investment.

### 5.1. OpenShift Monitoring Stack: Prometheus and Grafana

OpenShift Container Platform includes a robust monitoring stack by default, based on the industry-standard open-source tools Prometheus and Grafana. Prometheus is responsible for collecting and storing metrics, while Grafana provides dashboards for visualizing that data.

This stack is primarily configured to monitor the health of the cluster itself (nodes, Operators, API server, etc.), but by enabling the "user workload monitoring" feature, it can also collect application metrics. When this feature is enabled, a separate Prometheus instance is deployed in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace, separate from the one for cluster monitoring. This allows developers to monitor the performance of their own applications while preventing a large volume of application metrics from affecting the stability of the entire cluster.

### 5.2. Visualizing Network Metrics

To visualize the network using Prometheus and Grafana, it is first necessary to collect the appropriate metrics. Components like `kube-state-metrics` and `node-exporter` expose basic network statistics at the Pod and node level (bytes sent/received, packet count, etc.).

For more advanced visibility, OpenShift provides the `Network Observability Operator`. This Operator uses eBPF to efficiently collect network flow data within the node and enriches it with Kubernetes metadata (Pod name, namespace, labels, etc.). The collected flow data is not only stored as logs in Loki but also exposed as Prometheus metrics. This allows for more detailed network analysis on a Grafana dashboard, such as the total traffic volume between specific namespaces or the number of dropped packets for a specific Pod.

### 5.3. Community Dashboards and Customization

Building a Grafana dashboard from scratch can be time-consuming, but numerous dashboards created by the community can be imported and used. The official Grafana Labs website and GitHub have dashboards specialized for Kubernetes and OpenShift network monitoring, providing an excellent starting point for visualizing cluster-wide, per-node, and per-Pod network throughput and connectivity status.

It is also possible to customize these existing dashboards or create your own. The specific steps involve first deploying a dedicated Grafana instance via the Grafana Operator, then setting up the Prometheus in `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` as a data source. After that, you can query the necessary metrics using PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) and build a dashboard by combining panels such as graphs and tables.

However, while this native monitoring stack is very powerful, maximizing its potential requires considerable expertise. To obtain meaningful network insights, operators must understand which metrics to collect, correctly configure `ServiceMonitor` resources, and, most importantly, be able to write complex PromQL queries to transform raw data into useful information. Skills in building and maintaining effective Grafana dashboards are also necessary. Therefore, while the software license for the native stack is "free," the total cost of ownership (TCO), including engineering time and training, can be high. Commercial solutions often lower this operational barrier by providing pre-built dashboards, intuitive UIs, and query-less auto-discovery features, thus justifying their cost.

## Chapter 6: Comparative Analysis and Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis so far, this chapter provides a direct comparison of each solution and offers concrete guidance for making the optimal choice based on organizational needs.

### 6.1. Solution Comparison Matrix

The following table summarizes the architecture, features, and characteristics of the main network observability solutions analyzed in this report.

| Solution | Architectural Approach | Primary Visualization Interface | L7 Protocol Visibility | Security Enforcement Mechanism | Performance Overhead | Primary Target Persona/Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cilium / Hubble** | eBPF CNI | Hubble UI, Grafana | Yes (HTTP, gRPC, DNS, Kafka) | CiliumNetworkPolicy (eBPF) | Low | Platform/DevOps, Security |
| **OpenShift Service Mesh / Kiali** | Service Mesh (Sidecar) | Kiali Dashboard, Grafana | Yes (HTTP, gRPC, etc. via Envoy) | Istio AuthorizationPolicy | Medium to High | Application Developers, Platform/DevOps |
| **Cisco ACI CNI** | Fabric-Integrated CNI | Cisco APIC | No (Up to L4) | ACI Contracts / EPGs | Low | Network Operations |
| **Cisco Secure Workload** | API Integration & Host Agent | Secure Workload UI | Yes (via flow metadata) | Generated iptables/host FW rules | Medium | Security Operations, Compliance |
| **Arista CloudVision / Container Tracer** | API Integration & Switch Telemetry | CloudVision UI | No | External Integration | Low | Network Operations |
| **F5 BIG-IP / CIS** | Ingress Controller | External Analytics Platform (Splunk, ELK) | Yes (North-South traffic) | BIG-IP WAF / AFM | Depends on Ingress traffic | NetOps, SecOps (Edge Security) |
| **Native Stack (Prometheus/Grafana)** | eBPF (NetObs Operator) & Exporters | Grafana | Limited (via NetObs Operator) | Kubernetes NetworkPolicy | Low to Medium | Platform/DevOps (DIY) |

*Note on Performance Overhead:*

  * **Low:** Processing is primarily completed in kernel space (eBPF) or network hardware, minimizing impact on workloads.
  * **Medium:** Requires an agent running on the host or limited user-space processing.
  * **High:** Injects a user-space proxy (sidecar) into each application Pod, leading to a noticeable increase in CPU and memory consumption.

### 6.2. Analysis of Key Trade-offs

The choice of a solution should be made not by a simple feature comparison, but by an evaluation of trade-offs based on the organization's priorities.

  * **Performance vs. Depth of Features:** This is the central trade-off between eBPF-based solutions and service meshes. eBPF solutions like Cilium have very low overhead because they operate at the kernel level, but they may not yet match the mature L7 traffic management features (retries, advanced routing, etc.) offered by service meshes like Istio. If advanced traffic control for improving application reliability is the top priority, a service mesh is a strong candidate. If strengthening the performance and security foundation is the priority, eBPF is a leading choice.
  * **Integrated Operations vs. Best-of-Breed:** Single-vendor fabric integration solutions like Cisco ACI have the powerful advantage of unifying the operation of containers and existing infrastructure, but they come with the risk of vendor lock-in. On the other hand, platform-agnostic tools like Cilium offer greater flexibility but may require additional effort to integrate with the existing network environment.
  * **Build vs. Buy:** The "build" approach, leveraging the OpenShift native monitoring stack, incurs no additional license costs but requires advanced expertise and continuous maintenance effort. Commercial "buy" solutions have a higher initial cost but offer benefits such as rapid time to value, professional support, and reduced operational load.

### 6.3. Mapping to Organizational Personas and Use Cases

The optimal solution depends on who is seeking visibility and for what purpose.

  * **For Network Operations Teams:** **Cisco ACI CNI** and **Arista CloudVision** are optimal as they are highly compatible with existing network management tools and can visualize physical, virtual, and container environments in a unified manner. These tools make it easy for network operators to incorporate the container environment into their existing operational models.
  * **For Platform/DevOps Teams:** If Kubernetes-native control and automation are a priority, **Cilium/Hubble** is a powerful choice. It provides a high-performance foundation with eBPF and observability that is highly compatible with DevOps workflows. For teams with extensive expertise, maximizing the use of the **native Prometheus/Grafana stack** is also possible.
  * **For Security Teams:** If application dependency mapping, correlation with vulnerability information, threat detection, and automatic generation of zero-trust policies are top priorities, **Cisco Secure Workload** is the most suitable. CNAPP solutions like **Sysdig** and **Aqua Security** also offer powerful features that integrate runtime security and network visibility.
  * **For Application Developers:** If advanced traffic control such as canary releases and A/B testing, or a detailed understanding of the behavior of the microservices they are responsible for, is desired, **OpenShift Service Mesh (Istio)/Kiali** provides the most value. It offers self-service features for developers to control traffic routing and observe performance.

### 6.4. Future Outlook: The Convergence of CNAPP and Network Observability

As an industry trend, it is expected that functions that have been treated separately, such as network visibility, security policy enforcement, vulnerability management, and compliance, will converge into a single Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP). Threats to container security exist throughout the entire lifecycle, from vulnerabilities in the image (build time), to cluster configuration errors (deployment time), and abnormal behavior on the network (runtime).

A forward-looking solution must provide an integrated approach that protects the entire lifecycle from "source to run," rather than treating these areas as separate. The visualization of network flows will not only monitor communication but will also be analyzed in conjunction with vulnerability information of the communicating workload and the behavior of the running processes. In this context, kernel-level technologies like eBPF will become increasingly important as a foundational technology for CNAPP, as they can collect diverse contexts (network, process, file access, etc.) with low overhead. Therefore, when selecting a network visualization solution today, it is extremely important to have a perspective on whether that solution can be extended and integrated into a comprehensive CNAPP strategy in the future.
